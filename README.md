# Python Quiz App




The Python Quiz App is a simple quiz application built using Python and the tkinter library. It allows users to test their knowledge of Python programming with a series of multiple-choice questions. Users can answer questions, track their scores, and view correct answers for questions they've answered incorrectly.

## Features

- Timer to complete the quiz.
- Score tracking and display.
- Review of incorrect answers.
- Restart or retake the quiz.


### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your computer.



## Timer Functionality

The Python Quiz App includes a timer feature that adds an element of challenge to the quiz-taking experience. Here's how it works:

- **Countdown Timer**: When a user starts a quiz, a countdown timer is initiated with a default time limit of 30 seconds for each question.

- **Visual Indication**: The timer is displayed on the user interface, allowing the user to keep track of the remaining time.

- **Timer Color Changes**: The timer color changes to red when there are less than 10 seconds remaining, providing a visual alert.

- **Button Color Changes**: The color of the "Next" and "Finish Test" buttons also changes based on the remaining time, with "Next" button turning green and "Finish Test" button turning red when needed.

- **Auto Submission**: If the timer reaches zero while a question is unanswered, the quiz is automatically submitted, ensuring that users complete the quiz within the time limit.

- **User Experience**: The timer adds an element of excitement to the quiz and encourages users to answer questions promptly.
